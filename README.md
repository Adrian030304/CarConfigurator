Configurator Project
Project Description
The Configurator Project is a web application I built using ASP.NET for a uni project. It allows users to configure a product based on their preferences and get a customized offer. The main class, Configurator, handles user interactions, calculates the final price, and shows the offer details on another page.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give users an easy way to customize a product and see the total cost with their selected options. Users can choose different equipment levels, optional features, extended warranty, and payment methods, and the app updates the price accordingly. The final offer is shown on a separate page called Offer.aspx, and all the data is passed through session variables and query strings.

Data Handling
The app collects the user's first name, last name, offer date, and expiration date, and transfers this data to Offer.aspx. The prices and selected options are stored in session variables to keep the data throughout the session.

The app has been created keeping in mind OOP principles and basic programming along with html for the structure of the website.
